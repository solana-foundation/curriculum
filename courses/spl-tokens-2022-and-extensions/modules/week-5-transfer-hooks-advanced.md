# Week 5: Transfer Hooks - Advanced Implementation

## Learning Objectives

- Build complex transfer hook logic with multiple validations
- Implement KYC/compliance patterns with transfer hooks
- Optimize compute usage in transfer hooks
- Handle transfer hook program updates

## Topics Covered

- Advanced validation patterns (KYC, compliance, limits)
- Compute unit optimization for hooks
- Transfer hook program upgrade patterns
- Integration with external programs via CPI
- Order tracking and analytics implementations
- Security considerations and attack vectors

## Hands-on Exercises

1. **KYC Transfer Hook**: Implement identity verification requirements
2. **Analytics Hook**: Track volume, frequency, and patterns
3. **Conditional Fee Hook**: Variable fees based on transfer context

- [Order Tracker Hook](https://github.com/buffalojoec/transfer-hook-order-tracker)
- Security audit reports on transfer hook implementations

## Homework

- Build a production-ready compliance transfer hook system:
  - Multi-tier KYC levels (Basic, Enhanced, Institutional)
  - Daily/monthly transfer limits per tier
  - Geo-restriction capabilities
  - Suspicious activity detection
  - Admin override capabilities
  - Comprehensive audit trail
- Implement gas optimization techniques
- Create admin UI for managing hook parameters
- Write security test suite covering edge cases
- Benchmark performance with various transfer volumes
