  - Checks if sender has a "verified" PDA account
  - Validates transfer amount is within limits (min: 10, max: 1000)
  - Emits custom events for monitoring
  - Includes proper ExtraAccountMetaList setup
- Write comprehensive tests using Anchor's testing framework
- Create client-side code to interact with hook-enabled tokens
- Document all failure scenarios and error messages
