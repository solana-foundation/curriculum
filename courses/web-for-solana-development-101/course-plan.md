# Web for Solana Development 101: Foundations and Anchor dApp Basics

## Overview

This course provides a **comprehensive foundation in building decentralized application (dApp) frontends** on the Solana blockchain using modern web technologies. Learners will master Solana web development through the emerging `gill` library—a lightweight, modern alternative to traditional Web3.js—while building practical interfaces that connect to the Solana network. The curriculum emphasizes **modern JavaScript/TypeScript patterns** and how Solana's unique architecture enables high-performance blockchain applications. To solidify these concepts, the course culminates in building a **full-stack note-taking dApp** with an Anchor backend. This project serves as a practical application of the learned fundamentals, demonstrating real-world patterns for wallet integration, transaction handling, and on-chain data management. The skills acquired are essential for modern blockchain development, preparing students for careers in the rapidly evolving Web3 ecosystem.

The primary goal is to equip developers with a robust and practical Solana web development skillset, enabling them to build efficient, user-friendly dApps that leverage Solana's speed and low transaction costs.

## Learning Objectives

- **Master Solana's web development ecosystem**: RPC connections, transaction lifecycle, and account model.
- Set up and configure a modern Solana development environment with Node.js, TypeScript, and the `gill` library.
- Implement wallet integration using `@solana/wallet-adapter-react` and create custom UI components with Tailwind CSS.
- Construct, sign, and send Solana transactions using `gill`'s modern API (`createTransaction`, `signTransactionMessageWithSigners`, `sendAndConfirmTransaction`).
- Understand the Interface Definition Language (IDL) pattern for type-safe program interactions.
- Build production-ready dApps using the `@coral-xyz/anchor` client library for program interactions.
- Implement robust error handling and transaction confirmation strategies.
- Create responsive, accessible web interfaces following Web3 UX best practices.
- Deploy and interact with Anchor programs across different Solana clusters (devnet, testnet, mainnet-beta).

## Prerequisites

- Solid understanding of JavaScript ES6+ and basic TypeScript.
- Familiarity with React.js and component-based architecture.
- Basic knowledge of REST APIs and asynchronous programming.
- Understanding of fundamental web development (HTML, CSS).
- Command-line interface proficiency.
- General understanding of blockchain concepts is helpful but not required.
- No prior Solana or Rust experience necessary.

## Course Outline

The course will cover the following key areas, culminating in the final project:
