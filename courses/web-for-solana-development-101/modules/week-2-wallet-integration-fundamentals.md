# Week 2: Wallet Integration Fundamentals

## Overview

This week covers integrating Solana wallets into web applications using the `wallet-ui` library and modern wallet adapter patterns. Topics include building robust wallet connection interfaces, handling multiple wallet types, and implementing wallet-based authentication.

## Learning Objectives

Learning outcomes for this week include:

1. Set up wallet providers using `@wallet-ui/react`
2. Build custom wallet connection UI components
3. Handle wallet connection states and errors gracefully
4. Support multiple wallet adapters (Phantom, Solflare, Backpack)
5. Implement auto-connect and wallet persistence features

## Lessons

### Lesson 1: Setting Up Wallet Providers

**Topics Covered:**
- Understanding the wallet adapter architecture
- Configuring `WalletUi` provider
- Cluster management with wallet-ui
- Storage patterns for wallet preferences
- Provider composition in React

**Lab Exercise: Setting Up Wallet Providers**

Implement an app providers component that:
- Imports necessary wallet-ui components and utilities
- Creates cluster storage for persisting user's cluster selection
- Configures wallet UI with all Solana clusters (devnet, localnet, testnet, mainnet)
- Sets up provider hierarchy with WalletUi wrapping other providers
- Enables auto-detection of installed wallets
- Integrates with React Query for data fetching

**Key Concepts:**
- Provider hierarchy and context
- Cluster configuration and switching
- Wallet auto-detection
- Storage abstraction for preferences

### Lesson 2: Building Wallet Connection UI

**Topics Covered:**
- Using wallet-ui hooks: `useWallets`, `useWalletUi`
- Creating wallet selection modal
- Responsive wallet button design
- Handling connection loading states
- Accessibility considerations

**Lab Exercise: Building Wallet Connection UI**

Create a WalletButton component that:
- Uses wallet-ui hooks to access wallet state and functions
- Displays different UI based on connection status:
  - When connected: Shows truncated public key with disconnect option
  - When disconnected: Shows "Connect Wallet" button
- Implements modal pattern for wallet selection
- Handles wallet connection through modal selection
- Applies appropriate styling for different states
- Manages modal visibility with local state

**Key Concepts:**
- Conditional rendering based on wallet state
- User-friendly address display
- Modal patterns for wallet selection
- Loading and error states

### Lesson 3: Advanced Wallet Features

**Topics Covered:**
- Auto-connect implementation
- Wallet persistence with localStorage
- Handling wallet events
- Multi-wallet support patterns
- Security considerations

**Lab Exercise: Implementing Auto-Connect**

Build a custom hook for auto-connect functionality that:
- Checks if user is already connected to avoid redundant attempts
- Retrieves saved wallet preference from localStorage
- Finds the saved wallet in available wallets list
- Verifies wallet is installed before attempting connection
- Automatically connects to previously used wallet on page load
- Saves wallet preference when user connects manually
- Uses proper React effect dependencies
- Handles edge cases gracefully

**Key Concepts:**
- Browser storage strategies
- Wallet ready states
- Event handling patterns
- Security best practices

## Practical Assignment

### Build a Complete Wallet Connection Experience

Create a wallet integration feature that includes:

1. **Custom Wallet Connection Button**
   - Shows connected state with truncated address
   - Displays wallet icon when connected
   - Smooth transitions between states

2. **Wallet Selection Modal**
   - Lists all detected wallets
   - Shows installation prompts for missing wallets
   - Includes wallet icons and descriptions
   - Mobile-responsive design

3. **Auto-Connect Feature**
   - Remembers user's wallet choice
   - Attempts auto-connect on page load
   - Handles errors gracefully

4. **Wallet Info Display**
   - Shows full public key with copy button
   - Displays SOL balance
   - Shows connected cluster
   - Includes disconnect option

**Requirements:**
- Use wallet-ui patterns from examples
- Implement proper error handling
- Add loading states for all async operations
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Include accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

**Implementation Guidelines:**

1. **WalletProvider Component**
   - Configure wallet-ui with appropriate settings
   - Add error boundary for graceful error handling
   - Implement auto-connect functionality
   - Set up proper provider hierarchy

2. **WalletConnect Component**
   - Build intuitive connection UI
   - Handle all connection states (disconnected, connecting, connected, error)
   - Add smooth animations for state transitions
   - Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes

3. **WalletInfo Component**
   - Display complete wallet information (address, balance, cluster)
   - Implement copy-to-clipboard for public key
   - Show real-time SOL balance
   - Add disconnect functionality
   - Include visual indicators for connection status

### Practice Exercises
1. Add wallet switching without disconnecting
2. Implement a "recently used wallets" section
3. Create wallet connection analytics
4. Build a mini wallet dashboard

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Wallet not detected
**Solution:** 
- Check wallet ready state before attempting connection
- If wallet is not detected, provide installation link
- Open wallet download page in new tab
- Show helpful message to user about installing wallet

### Issue: Auto-connect loops
**Solution:** 
- Implement connection attempt tracking with state
- Add guards to prevent multiple connection attempts
- Use debouncing techniques for connection logic
- Track connection history to avoid infinite loops

### Issue: Wallet disconnects on page refresh
**Solution:** Implement proper persistence and re-connection logic

## Week 2 Quiz Questions

1. What is the purpose of the wallet adapter pattern?
2. How do you handle multiple wallet types in a single interface?
3. Explain the wallet ready states and their meanings
4. What security considerations apply to auto-connect features?
5. How can you improve wallet connection UX for mobile users?

## Hands-On Challenge

### Wallet Connection Speed Run

Build a wallet connection interface with these constraints:
- Must connect in under 3 clicks
- Should remember last used wallet
- Must work on mobile devices
- Include visual feedback for all states
- Handle errors gracefully

**Bonus Points:**
- Add wallet balance display
- Implement ENS/SNS domain resolution
- Create custom wallet icons
- Add connection animations
