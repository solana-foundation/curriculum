**Lab Exercise: Optimistic Updates and Caching**

**useOptimisticMutation Hook:**

1. **Hook Structure:**
   - Accept mutation function and options
   - Use React Query's useMutation internally
   - Configure optimistic update lifecycle

2. **Mutation Lifecycle:**
   - **onMutate**: 
     - Cancel in-flight queries
     - Snapshot current data
     - Apply optimistic update
     - Return context for rollback
   - **onError**:
     - Restore previous data from context
     - Call custom rollback handler
     - Show error notification
   - **onSettled**:
     - Invalidate queries to ensure fresh data

     - Proper error handling

2. **Post Updates with Conflict Resolution:**
   - Fetch latest version before update
   - Compare local and remote versions
   - Implement conflict resolution:
     - Call resolver function if versions differ
     - Update with incremented version
   - Apply optimistic changes immediately
   - Rollback on error

3. **UI Implementation:**

- Optimistic update patterns
- Query cancellation
- Rollback mechanisms
- Conflict detection
- Cache synchronization
