### Lesson 3: Wallet Integration and Authentication

**Topics Covered:**
- Implementing wallet-based authentication
- Creating user profiles on-chain
- Session management
- Protected routes
- Multi-wallet support

**Lab Exercise: Wallet Integration and Authentication**

**1. Auth Store Implementation (Zustand):**

**Store Structure:**
- Define authentication state interface
- Track authentication status, profile, wallet, loading, and errors
- Implement action methods for auth operations

**Core Methods:**
- **signIn**: Check for existing profile and update auth state
- **signOut**: Clear all authentication data
- **checkProfile**: Derive PDA and fetch profile data
- **createProfile**: Execute on-chain profile creation

**PDA Derivation:**
- Use 'profile' seed with wallet public key
- Consistent PDA generation across methods
- Handle fetch errors gracefully

**2. Auth Provider Component:**

**Integration Points:**
- Connect wallet-ui hooks for wallet state
- Use Anchor program hook
- Access auth store actions

**Lifecycle Management:**
- Monitor wallet connection changes
- Auto-signin when wallet connects
- Auto-signout on disconnect
- Handle program availability

**3. Protected Route Implementation:**

**Route Protection Logic:**
- Check authentication status
- Redirect to home if not authenticated
- Show loading screen during auth check
- Render children only when authenticated

**Navigation Handling:**
- Use Next.js router for redirects
- Implement proper loading states
- Prevent content flash

**4. Profile Creation Modal:**

**Form Setup:**
- Define Zod schema for validation
- Username constraints (3-32 chars, alphanumeric)
- Use react-hook-form with Zod resolver

**Modal Features:**
- Full-screen overlay with backdrop
- Centered modal container
- Form with validation feedback
- Loading states during creation
- Success/error handling

**Profile Creation Flow:**
- Validate username input
- Call store's createProfile method
- Handle success with modal close
- Display errors appropriately

**Key Concepts:**
- Wallet-based authentication flow
- State management with Zustand
- Protected route implementation
- Profile creation patterns
- Form validation
