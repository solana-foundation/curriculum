## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: RPC endpoint failures in production
**Solution:** Implement fallback strategy:
```typescript
const endpoints = ['primary', 'fallback1', 'fallback2'];
for (const endpoint of endpoints) {
    try {
        return await makeRpcCall(endpoint);
    } catch (error) {
        continue;
    }
}
```

### Issue: High error rates after deployment
**Solution:** Implement canary deployments:
```typescript
// Route 10% of traffic to new version
if (Math.random() < 0.1) {
    return redirectToCanary();
}
```

### Issue: Memory leaks in production
**Solution:** Add memory monitoring:
```typescript
setInterval(() => {
    const usage = process.memoryUsage();
    if (usage.heapUsed > threshold) {
        gracefulRestart();
    }
}, 60000);
```
