# Solana DeFi: Token Swaps and AMMs

## Overview

This course delves into fundamental and advanced Decentralized Finance (DeFi) concepts on the Solana blockchain, with a specific focus on the mechanics of token swaps and Automated Market Makers (AMMs). The primary objective is to provide a clear understanding of how these core DeFi primitives operate, from basic token exchange logic to the complexities of AMM design, including liquidity provision, price calculation, and Liquidity Provider (LP) token management.

Learners will explore Cross-Program Invocations (CPIs) for token transfers, management of token accounts, the significance of liquidity pools, price determination strategies, and the role of LP tokens. The course breaks down these complex DeFi components into understandable segments.

The final project involves implementing the on-chain logic for a basic constant product AMM (`x*y=k`).

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the mechanics of token swaps and basic exchange logic.
- Securely perform Cross-Program Invocations (CPIs) for token transfers.
- Manage token accounts and balances within Solana programs.
- Implement the core logic of an Automated Market Maker (e.g., constant product formula).
- Understand the role and management of liquidity pools.
- Calculate token prices based on AMM formulas and pool ratios.
- Handle the minting, burning, and tracking of Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens.
- Understand and mitigate issues like slippage in token swaps.

## Prerequisites

- Foundational knowledge of Rust programming.
- Basic understanding of Solana's architecture and smart contracts.
- General awareness of SPL Tokens (mints, accounts, transfers). Key concepts will be reinforced.
- Familiarity with the Anchor framework is helpful, or a readiness to learn its basics during the course.

## Course Outline

1.  **Introduction to DeFi on Solana:**
    - Overview of the DeFi ecosystem on Solana.
    - Core DeFi primitives: lending, borrowing, exchanges.
    - Importance of token standards (SPL Token).
2.  **Token Swaps and Exchange Logic:**
    - Anatomy of a token swap.
    - Interacting with token accounts.
    - Using CPIs for secure token transfers.
    - Handling different token types and decimals.
3.  **Automated Market Makers (AMMs):**
    - Introduction to AMMs and their role in decentralized exchanges.
    - The constant product formula (`x*y=k`) and other AMM models.
    - Liquidity pools: providing and managing liquidity.
    - Price calculation and impact of trades.
    - Understanding impermanent loss.
4.  **Liquidity Provider (LP) Tokens:**
    - Minting LP tokens to represent shares in a liquidity pool.
    - Burning LP tokens to withdraw liquidity.
    - Tracking LP token ownership.
5.  **Building a Constant Product AMM:**
    - Designing the on-chain program structure (Anchor recommended).
    - Implementing functions for:
      - Initializing a new liquidity pool.
      - Adding liquidity (depositing tokens, minting LP tokens).
      - Removing liquidity (burning LP tokens, withdrawing tokens).
      - Performing token swaps.
    - Calculating swap amounts and handling slippage.

## Target Audience

This course is ideal for individuals with foundational knowledge of Rust and a basic understanding of Solana's architecture and SPL tokens, who are eager to dive into Decentralized Finance (DeFi) on Solana. It suits learners looking to understand the core mechanics of decentralized exchanges, AMMs, and liquidity provision, building upon concepts from introductory Solana, Rust, and Anchor programming.

- **Level:** Intermediate.
