# Blockchain and Distributed Systems: Theory and Practice with Solana

## Overview

This course provides a comprehensive exploration of blockchain technology through the lens of distributed systems theory, using Solana as a primary case study for modern blockchain innovations. The course bridges classical distributed systems concepts with contemporary blockchain architectures, emphasizing the computer science foundations that enable decentralized consensus at scale.

Beginning with fundamental distributed systems principles established by pioneers like Lamport and Lynch, students will progressively build understanding of consensus mechanisms, Byzantine fault tolerance, and cryptographic primitives. The course then examines how these classical concepts manifest in blockchain systems, starting with Bitcoin's elegant but limited approach, progressing through various consensus mechanisms, and culminating in Solana's innovative solutions to the blockchain trilemma.

Rather than focusing on programming implementation, this course emphasizes theoretical understanding and system design. Students will analyze trade-offs in distributed system design, evaluate different consensus algorithms, and understand how Solana's Proof of History, Tower BFT, and parallel transaction processing represent novel approaches to longstanding distributed systems challenges. The course concludes with students designing and analyzing their own distributed ledger system, applying learned principles to address specific use cases.
