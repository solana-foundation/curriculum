# Week 4: Cryptography Basics for Blockchain

## Learning Objectives

- Understand hash functions (blockchain's building block)
- Learn about digital signatures (proving who you are)
- See how these enable trustless systems
- Build your first cryptographic application

## Topics Covered

- Hash functions explained simply
- What makes a hash function secure?
- Digital signatures = unforgeable signatures
- Public and private keys
- How Bitcoin uses these tools

## Reading Assignment

- **Required**: "Cryptography for Blockchain" - introductory guide
- **Watch**: "How Bitcoin Works Under the Hood" (focus on crypto parts)

## Hands-on Exercises

1. **Hash Explorer**: Play with online hash calculators
2. **Sign and Verify**: Use a tool to sign messages
3. **Build a Chain**: Connect blocks with hashes

## Homework

- Code: Create a simple password storage system using hashes
- Code: Build a basic digital signature checker
- Experiment: Try to "break" MD5 (hint: use online tools)

## Lab: "Crypto Tools Workshop"

- Use Python libraries for hashing and signing
- Build a simple proof-of-work miner
- Create your first blockchain!
