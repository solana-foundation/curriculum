# Week 13: Making Blockchains Fast

## Learning Objectives

- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Understand scaling approaches
- Learn about hardware's role
- Compare different solutions

## Topics Covered

- Where blockchains get slow
- Vertical scaling (Solana's way)
- Horizontal scaling (sharding)
- Layer 2 solutions
- Real-world performance

## Reading Assignment

- **Required**: "Blockchain Scalability Explained" - visual guide
- **Watch**: "Why Blockchains are Slow" - Finematics

## Hands-on Exercises

1. **Bottleneck Hunt**: Find the slow parts
2. **Scaling Simulator**: Try different approaches
3. **Performance Test**: Measure real chains

## Homework

- Benchmark 3 different blockchains
- Design: How would you make Bitcoin faster?
- Research: One scaling solution in depth

## Lab: "Performance Workshop"

- Profile blockchain transactions
- Compare speeds and costs
- Build a performance dashboard access
  - Network I/O

2. **Compression**:

   - Transaction compression
   - State compression
   - Block compression
   - Network protocols

3. **Caching**:
   - State caching
   - Signature cache
   - Transaction cache
   - Network route cache

## Case Studies

- **Ethereum Gas Limits**: Economic throttling
- **Bitcoin's Conservative Approach**: 1MB blocks
- **BSC's Centralization Trade-off**: 21 validators
