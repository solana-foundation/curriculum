# Week 6: How Computers Agree - Consensus Basics

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the consensus problem
- Learn about leaders and followers
- Compare Paxos and Raft (Raft is easier!)
- See how traditional systems reach agreement

## Topics Covered

- What is consensus?
- Leader-based consensus
- Raft: the understandable algorithm
- How companies use these algorithms
- Why blockchain does it differently

## Reading Assignment

- **Required**: "In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm" - Intro and Section 2
- **Watch**: Raft visualization video

## Hands-on Exercises

1. **Raft Visualization**: Play with online Raft simulator
2. **Leader Election**: Act out the algorithm in class
3. **Build Consensus**: Simple majority voting system

## Homework

- Use Raft visualization to create 5 different scenarios
- Code: Implement basic leader election
- Compare: How is blockchain consensus different? (1 page)

## Lab: "Consensus Playground"

- Use Raft simulator to break and fix consensus
- Implement a simple replicated counter
- Test with failures
