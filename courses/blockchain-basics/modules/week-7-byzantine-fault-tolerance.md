# Week 7: Byzantine Fault Tolerance - Handling Malicious Actors

## Learning Objectives

- Understand Byzantine faults in simple terms
- Learn how PBFT works (simplified)
- See why Byzantine consensus is expensive
- Connect to blockchain's approach

## Topics Covered

- Byzantine faults = lying/malicious nodes
- Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance basics
- Why we need more nodes (3f+1 rule)
- Message complexity and costs
- Modern improvements

## Reading Assignment

- **Required**: "PBFT Explained Simply" - blog post
- **Watch**: "Byzantine Fault Tolerance" - visual explanation

## Hands-on Exercises

1. **Byzantine Game**: Role-play Byzantine generals
2. **PBFT Simulator**: Use online tool
3. **Cost Calculator**: Count messages needed

## Homework

- Implement a simple Byzantine fault detector
- Calculate: How many messages for 10 nodes?
- Essay: "Why is blockchain's approach different?" (2 pages)

## Lab: "Byzantine Behavior Workshop"

- Simulate different attack strategies
- See why honest majority matters
- Compare costs with crash-only systems
