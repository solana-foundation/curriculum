# Week 11: Solana's Innovation - Proof of History

## Learning Objectives

- Understand Solana's big idea
- Learn how Proof of History works
- See why time helps consensus
- Compare with other blockchains

## Topics Covered

- The problem: blockchains are slow
- Solana's solution: built-in clock
- How Proof of History works
- Why it enables high speed
- Integration with other parts

## Reading Assignment

- **Required**: [Proof of History: Bringing Time to Crypto](https://solana.com/news/proof-of-history) - Solana's explanation of PoH
- **Supplementary**: [Solana Developer Documentation](https://solana.com/developers/docs) - General Solana documentation

## Hands-on Exercises

1. **Build a Clock**: SHA-256 chain demonstration
2. **Verify History**: Check proofs in parallel
3. **Speed Test**: Compare with Bitcoin

## Homework

- Code: Implement basic Proof of History
- Measure: Time to generate vs. verify
- Essay: "Why didn't Bitcoin think of this?" (1 page)

## Lab: "Solana's Secret Sauce"

- Build a PoH generator
- Add events to the timeline
- See the speed difference
