# Week 3: When Things Go Wrong - Failure Models

## Learning Objectives

- Learn different ways computers can fail
- Understand Byzantine failures (lying computers!)
- See why some failures are harder to handle
- Introduction to the Byzantine Generals story

## Topics Covered

- Types of failures:
  - Crash (computer stops)
  - Network problems
  - Byzantine (computer lies)
- The Byzantine Generals Problem explained
- Why Bitcoin assumes some miners might be evil
- Basic solutions to different failures

## Reading Assignment

- **Required**: "The Byzantine Generals Problem" - simplified blog version
- **Watch**: "Byzantine Fault Tolerance Explained" (YouTube, 20 min)

## Hands-on Exercises

1. **Failure Types Game**: Act out different failures in class
2. **Byzantine Generals**: Solve the puzzle with 4 generals
3. **Trust Exercise**: When can we trust a computer's message?

## Homework

- Implement a voting system that handles crashed voters
- Modify it to handle lying voters (harder!)
- Essay: "How does Bitcoin handle lying miners?" (2 pages)

## Lab: "Building Trust in Untrusted Systems"

- Play with a Byzantine Generals simulator
- Try different strategies
- See why 3f+1 computers are needed for f liars
