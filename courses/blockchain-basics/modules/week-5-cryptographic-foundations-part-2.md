# Week 5: Advanced Crypto - Merkle Trees and Privacy

## Learning Objectives

- Master Merkle trees (Bitcoin's data structure)
- Understand basic privacy concepts
- Learn about randomness in blockchain
- See how Solana uses special crypto

## Topics Covered

- Merkle trees: organizing data efficiently
- Proving something exists without showing everything
- Introduction to zero-knowledge (hiding secrets)
- Random number generation in blockchain
- Verifiable Delay Functions (Solana's innovation)

## Reading Assignment

- **Required**: "Merkle Trees Explained" - visual guide
- **Watch**: "Zero Knowledge Proofs" - beginner friendly video

## Hands-on Exercises

1. **Build a Merkle Tree**: Visual implementation
2. **Hide and Seek**: Simple zero-knowledge game
3. **Random Numbers**: Why they're hard in blockchain

## Homework

- Code: Implement a Merkle tree for a file system
- Project: Create a simple lottery using randomness
- Research: How does Solana use VDFs? (1 page summary)

## Lab: "Privacy and Verification"

- Build a system to prove account balance without revealing it
- Create efficient proofs using Merkle trees
- Experiment with commitment schemes
