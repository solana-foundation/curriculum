# Week 10: Beyond Bitcoin - Proof of Stake and Others

## Learning Objectives

- Understand Proof of Stake basics
- Compare energy usage with PoW
- Learn about different blockchain approaches
- Explore the blockchain trilemma

## Topics Covered

- Proof of Stake explained simply
- Validators instead of miners
- Ethereum's transition to PoS
- Other approaches: DPoS, PoA
- The trilemma: pick 2 of 3

## Reading Assignment

- **Required**: "Proof of Stake Explained" - Ethereum.org
- **Watch**: "The Merge" - Ethereum's transition story

## Hands-on Exercises

1. **Stake Simulator**: See how validators are chosen
2. **Compare Energy**: PoW vs PoS calculator
3. **Trilemma Game**: Design trade-offs

## Homework

- Design your own consensus mechanism (be creative!)
- Compare: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum energy usage
- Stake some testnet ETH (using faucets)

## Lab: "Consensus Comparison"

- Try different consensus simulators
- Calculate attack costs
- Discuss pros and cons of each
