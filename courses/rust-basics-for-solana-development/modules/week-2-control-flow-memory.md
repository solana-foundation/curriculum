# Week 2: Control Flow & Memory

## Learning Objectives

- Master Rust's control flow constructs
- Understand stack vs heap memory
- Work with compound data types
- Grasp memory safety principles

## Topics Covered

- if/else expressions and match statements
- Loops: loop, while, for
- Arrays and tuples
- String vs &str
- Stack and heap allocation
- Memory safety without garbage collection

## Hands-on Exercises

1. **FizzBuzz with a Twist**: Blockchain block height version
2. **Memory Visualizer**: Program showing stack/heap allocation
3. **String Manipulation**: Working with String and &str

## Reading Assignment

- The Rust Book: Chapter 4.1-4.2
- Brown University Interactive Rust: Memory module

## Homework

- Implement a blockchain height validator:
  - Accept height as command line argument
  - Validate range (0 to 1,000,000)
  - Check if height is "special" (divisible by 1000)
  - Use both if/else and match statements
- Complete these [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises:
  - [`primitive_types/*`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/tree/main/exercises/04_primitive_types) (all 6 exercises)
  - [`strings/*`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/tree/main/exercises/09_strings) (all 4 exercises - String vs &str)
  - [`if/*`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/tree/main/exercises/03_if) (all 3 exercises)
