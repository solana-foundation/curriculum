# Week 7: Collections & Iterators

## Learning Objectives

- Use Vec<T> and HashMap effectively
- Master iterator patterns
- Chain iterator methods
- Understand iterator performance

## Topics Covered

- Vector operations and capacity
- HashMap and BTreeMap
- Iterator trait and methods
- collect() and type annotations
- Iterator combinators

## Hands-on Exercises

1. **Address Book**: HashMap-based storage
2. **Iterator Gym**: Practice with map, filter, fold
3. **Collection Transformer**: Convert between collection types

## Reading Assignment

- The Rust Book: Chapter 8, 13.2
- Rust by Example: Collections

## Homework

- Build an in-memory key-value database using HashMap with:
  - CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
  - Search functionality using iterators
  - Export/import to JSON
- Complete these iterator exercises:
  - [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings): `vec1-2.rs`, `hashmap1-3.rs`, `iterators1-5.rs` (10 exercises)
  - [Exercism Rust Track](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust):
    - "Accumulate" (iterator basics)
    - "Series" (iterator windows)
    - "Parallel Letter Frequency" (advanced iterators)
