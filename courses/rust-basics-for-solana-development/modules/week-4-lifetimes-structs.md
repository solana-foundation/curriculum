# Week 4: Lifetimes & Structs

## Learning Objectives

- Understand lifetime annotations
- Create and use structs effectively
- Implement methods and associated functions
- Work with tuple structs and unit structs

## Topics Covered

- Lifetime syntax and rules
- Struct definition and instantiation
- Methods vs associated functions
- impl blocks
- Tuple structs and newtype pattern

## Hands-on Exercises

1. **Account Struct**: Create a blockchain account representation
2. **Lifetime Detective**: Add lifetime annotations to fix code
3. **Method Chaining**: Build a fluent API with structs

## Reading Assignment
