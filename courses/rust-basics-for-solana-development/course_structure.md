The course is divided into four main parts:

### [PART 1: CORE RUST FUNDAMENTALS (Lessons 1-7)](./rust-solana-course/part1_core_rust_fundamentals/README.md)

Focuses on the core fundamental concepts of the Rust programming language, including setup, variables, data types, functions, control flow, ownership, borrowing, structs, enums, pattern matching, modules, error handling, and common collections.

### [PART 2: ADVANCED RUST, TOOLING, AND PREPARING FOR NETWORKED APPLICATIONS (Lessons 8-10)](./rust-solana-course/part2_advanced_rust_tooling_networking_prep/README.md)

Delves into more advanced Rust features like generics, traits, iterators, closures, and a deeper look at lifetimes. It also introduces asynchronous programming with Tokio and data serialization/deserialization with Serde.

### [PART 3: RUST FOR NETWORKED APPLICATIONS AND BLOCKCHAIN INTERACTION (CLIENT-SIDE) (Lessons 11-12)](./rust-solana-course/part3_rust_for_networked_applications_blockchain/README.md)

Transitions to applying Rust skills for building networked applications, focusing on CLI tools with `clap`, HTTP requests with `reqwest`, JSON handling with `serde`, and an introduction to Solana blockchain interaction using `solana-sdk` and `solana-client`.

### [PART 4: PROJECT: BUILDING A SOLANA ACCOUNT INSPECTOR CLI (Lessons 13-15)](./rust-solana-course/part4_project_solana_account_inspector/README.md)

The capstone project where students build a Solana Account Inspector CLI tool, applying all learned concepts to develop a practical application.
