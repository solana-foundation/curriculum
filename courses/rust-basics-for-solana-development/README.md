# Rust Programming: Core Concepts to CLI Application

## Overview

This course provides a **comprehensive and general foundation in Rust programming**, guiding learners from core concepts to building a practical Command-Line Interface (CLI) application. Learners will understand Rust's core featuresâ€”including its ownership model, data types, control flow, error handling, structs, enums, traits, and asynchronous programming. To solidify these concepts, the course culminates in building a **Solana Account Inspector CLI**. This project serves as a practical application of the learned Rust fundamentals, demonstrating their use in a real-world scenario involving external APIs and network interactions (specifically with the Solana blockchain using `solana-sdk`). The core Rust skills acquired are broadly transferable across diverse software development domains.

The primary goal is to equip developers with a robust and versatile Rust skillset, enabling them to write efficient, safe, and concurrent code for a wide range of applications, with the Solana client project offering a tangible example of these capabilities.

## Learning Objectives

- Master Rust's core concepts: ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, data types, and control flow.
- Effectively use Rust's structs, enums, and pattern matching.
- Implement robust error handling using `Result` and `Option`.
- Understand data serialization and deserialization concepts in Rust.
- Gain practical experience using the `solana-sdk` (specifically `solana-client`) to interact with the Solana network.
- Build a Solana Account Inspector CLI to query blockchain data like account balances.

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming experience in any language is helpful.
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces.
- Basic understanding of software development concepts.
- Prior blockchain experience is beneficial but not strictly required; the focus is on Rust.

## Course Outline

The course will cover the following key areas, culminating in the final project:

1.  **Core Rust Programming Concepts:**
    - Setting up the Rust development environment.
    - Variables, data types, functions, and control flow.
    - Deep dive into Rust's ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.
    - Structs, enums, and powerful pattern matching.
    - Comprehensive error handling with `Result` and `Option`.
    - Collections, Iterators, and Closures.
    - Basic generics and traits.
2.  **Rust for Networked Applications and Blockchain Interaction (Client-Side):**

    - Introduction to asynchronous programming in Rust (e.g., `async/await` with `tokio`).
    - Using Rust for building Command-Line Interface (CLI) tools (e.g., with `clap`).
    - Interacting with JSON APIs and handling responses in Rust.
    - Overview of the Solana RPC API and how to interact with it.
    - Introduction to the `solana-sdk` for client-side interactions:
      The `solana-sdk` has been modularized into smaller, independent crates. While this course will primarily utilize the main `solana-sdk` for foundational understanding, subsequent modules or advanced courses will explore using these more granular crates for optimized and specific use cases.

      - `solana-client` for making RPC requests.
      - Key data structures in `solana-sdk` (e.g., `Pubkey`, `Account`).

3.  **Project: Building a Solana Account Inspector CLI in Rust:**
    - Setting up a Rust project with `solana-sdk`, `tokio`, and `clap` dependencies.
    - Planning and designing the CLI command structure using the `clap` crate, considering commands such as `get-balance <PUBKEY>` and their respective arguments. This involves thinking ahead about user interaction and command organization.
    - Implementing asynchronous functions to connect to a Solana RPC endpoint and query account information.
    - Fetching and displaying the SOL balance for a given public key.
    - (Optional) Implementing other queries, such as fetching transaction history or token balances (if time permits and complexity is managed).
    - Robust error handling for network issues and invalid inputs.
    - Writing tests for the CLI application's core logic.
    - This project will solidify understanding of Rust for building practical tools that interact with external networks/APIs.

## Target Audience

This course is ideal for developers seeking a **strong, general foundation in Rust programming**. While the project involves interacting with the Solana network, the core learning outcomes are focused on Rust proficiency. It's excellent for those who prioritize learning Rust deeply and want a hands-on project to solidify their understanding of the language's capabilities in a practical, networked application context.

- **Level:** Beginner to Intermediate (in general programming).
