# PART 2: ADVANCED RUST, TOOLING, AND PREPARING FOR NETWORKED APPLICATIONS (Lessons 8-10)

This section of the course delves into more advanced Rust features and essential tooling for building robust applications. It covers generics and traits for writing flexible and reusable code, iterators and closures for expressive data processing, and a deeper look at lifetimes. Crucially, it introduces asynchronous programming with Tokio and data serialization/deserialization with Serde, which are fundamental for developing networked applications, including the final Solana CLI project.
