# Week 5: Advanced PDA Patterns and Hierarchical Data Models

## Learning Objectives

- Design complex PDA hierarchies for sophisticated data models
- Implement parent-child relationships using nested PDAs
- Master advanced seed patterns for scalable addressing
- Optimize PDA derivation for performance and gas efficiency
- Build systems with multiple levels of data organization

## Topics Covered

- Hierarchical PDA structures: parent-child relationships
- Advanced seed patterns: composite keys, counters, timestamps
- PDA pagination and enumeration strategies
- Cross-account references and validation patterns
- Performance optimization: seed length, bump caching
- Multi-level authority structures
- Dynamic PDA creation patterns

## Hands-on Exercises

1. **Hierarchical Data Storage**: Build a forum system with categories, posts, and comments
2. **Dynamic Collections**: Implement expandable collections using counter-based PDAs
3. **Authority Chains**: Create multi-level permission systems with PDA authorities
4. **Cross-Reference System**: Build interconnected PDAs with validation
5. **Performance Testing**: Benchmark different PDA patterns for efficiency

## Advanced PDA Patterns

### Parent-Child Hierarchies

```rust
// Parent: ["user", user_pubkey]
// Child: ["post", user_pda, post_id]
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct CreatePost<'info> {
    #[account(
        seeds = [b"user", authority.key().as_ref()],
        bump = user_account.bump
    )]
    pub user_account: Account<'info, UserAccount>,

    #[account(
        init,
        payer = authority,
        space = 8 + PostAccount::INIT_SPACE,
        seeds = [b"post", user_account.key().as_ref(), &user_account.post_count.to_le_bytes()],
        bump
    )]
    pub post_account: Account<'info, PostAccount>,
    // ...
}
```

### Counter-Based Collections

```rust
// Collection item: ["item", collection_pda, item_index]
#[account(
    init,
    payer = payer,
    space = 8 + ItemAccount::INIT_SPACE,
    seeds = [b"item", collection.key().as_ref(), &collection.item_count.to_le_bytes()],
    bump
)]
pub item: Account<'info, ItemAccount>,
```

### Cross-Reference Validation

```rust
// Validate parent-child relationship
#[account(
    constraint = comment.post == post.key() @ ErrorCode::InvalidParent
)]
pub comment: Account<'info, CommentAccount>,
```

## Performance Considerations

### Seed Optimization

- Keep seed lengths minimal for faster derivation
- Use fixed-size numeric seeds over variable strings
- Cache canonical bumps in parent accounts
- Batch PDA operations when possible

### Account Size Management

- Plan for account growth in hierarchical structures
- Use `realloc` for dynamic resizing
- Consider account splitting for large datasets
- Implement pagination for large collections

## Security Patterns

### Authority Validation

- Validate entire authority chains in hierarchical systems
- Implement proper access control at each level
- Use PDAs as program authorities for complex operations
- Validate cross-references between related accounts

### Data Integrity

- Ensure parent accounts exist before creating children
- Implement cascade deletion patterns carefully
- Validate account relationships in constraints
- Use discriminators to prevent account type confusion
