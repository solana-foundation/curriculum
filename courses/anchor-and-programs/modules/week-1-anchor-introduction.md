# Week 1: Anchor Framework Introduction and Workspace Setup

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the role of Anchor in Solana program development
- Set up a complete Anchor development environment
- Create and structure an Anchor workspace
- Write your first Anchor program (counter example)
- Understand Anchor's IDL generation and type safety benefits

## Topics Covered

- Anchor framework overview and advantages over native Solana programs
- Development environment setup (Rust, Solana CLI, Anchor CLI)
- Workspace structure and configuration files
- Program modules and organization patterns
- IDL (Interface Definition Language) generation
- Basic Anchor program anatomy: `lib.rs`, `Cargo.toml`, `Anchor.toml`
- Introduction to Anchor macros: `#[program]`, `#[derive(Accounts)]`, `#[account]`

## Hands-on Exercises

1. **Environment Setup**: Install and configure Rust, Solana CLI, and Anchor CLI
2. **First Anchor Project**: Initialize workspace with `anchor init` command
3. **Counter Program**: Build a simple counter program with increment/decrement functionality
4. **IDL Exploration**: Examine generated IDL and understand its structure
5. **Testing Setup**: Run basic tests using Anchor's testing framework
