# Week 13: Multi-Signature Protocol Engine - Core Architecture

## Learning Objectives

- Design and implement hierarchical approval structures for complex organizations
- Build role-based permission systems with granular access control
- Implement nested multi-signature wallets with delegation capabilities
- Create flexible threshold mechanisms for different operation types
- Develop comprehensive proposal and voting systems

## Topics Covered

- Multi-signature wallet architecture and security patterns
- Hierarchical approval structures: departments, teams, and individual roles
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with dynamic permission assignment
- Nested multi-sig patterns: organization → department → team → individual
- Threshold mechanisms: static vs dynamic, operation-specific thresholds
- Proposal lifecycle management: creation, review, approval, execution
- Security considerations: key management, authority validation, attack vectors

## Hands-on Exercises

1. **Core Multi-Sig Wallet**: Design and implement basic multi-signature functionality
2. **Hierarchical Structure**: Build nested approval hierarchies for organizational governance
3. **Role Management**: Create comprehensive role-based access control system
4. **Proposal System**: Implement proposal creation, voting, and execution mechanisms
5. **Security Testing**: Test against common multi-sig attack vectors and vulnerabilities

## Homework

- Design the complete multi-signature wallet data structures and account relationships
- Implement core multi-sig functionality: member management, threshold configuration, proposal creation
- Build comprehensive test suite covering all approval scenarios and edge cases
- Design role hierarchy system for a complex organization (minimum 3 levels)
- Create detailed documentation for the multi-sig protocol architecture
- Research and document multi-sig security best practices and common vulnerabilities

## Project Milestones

### Milestone 1: Core Infrastructure (Days 1-2)

- Multi-signature wallet account structure
- Member management system
- Basic proposal framework
- Threshold validation logic

### Milestone 2: Hierarchical Governance (Days 3-4)

- Organization/Department/Team structure
- Role-based permission system
- Nested approval chains
- Policy enforcement mechanisms

### Milestone 3: Proposal Lifecycle (Days 5-6)

- Proposal creation and categorization
- Voting mechanisms with weighted permissions
- Execution engine for different proposal types
- Event logging and audit trails

### Milestone 4: Security & Testing (Day 7)

- Security validation functions
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Attack vector mitigation
- Documentation and code review

## Key Concepts to Master

### Multi-Signature Fundamentals

- Threshold signature schemes and their security properties
- Account validation and constraint patterns in Anchor
- Nonce management for replay attack prevention
- Member lifecycle management (add/remove/modify)

### Hierarchical Approval Architecture

- Organizational structure modeling in on-chain accounts
- Delegation patterns and authority chains
- Spending limits and escalation procedures
- Policy-based approval routing

### Role-Based Access Control

- Permission inheritance and role hierarchies
- Dynamic permission evaluation
- Temporal access controls (expiration, activation)
- Audit trails for permission changes

### Proposal Management System

- Proposal categorization and routing
- Voting mechanisms (simple majority, weighted, quorum-based)
- Execution engines for different operation types
- Deadline management and expiration handling
