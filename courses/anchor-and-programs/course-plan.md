# Anchor and Programs: Framework Fundamentals to Production Blockchain Applications

## Overview

This comprehensive course provides a deep dive into the Anchor framework for Solana program development. It guides learners from foundational concepts, such as workspace setup and state definition, to advanced techniques like Cross-Program Invocations (CPIs) and Program Derived Addresses (PDAs). The curriculum emphasizes **secure smart contract development** and how Anchor's type-safe abstractions enable building sophisticated on-chain applications. To solidify these concepts, the course culminates in building a **Decentralized Event Ticketing System**. This project serves as a practical application of Anchor's core features, demonstrating real-world blockchain solutions for ticket fraud prevention, secondary market controls, and transparent event management.

The primary goal is to equip developers with production-ready Anchor skills, enabling them to build, test, and deploy secure on-chain programs. The course emphasizes a project-driven, hands-on approach where learners iteratively develop sophisticated blockchain applications. With the Solana ecosystem attracting over 7,600 new developers in 2024 and offering competitive salaries exceeding $150,000 for experienced developers, this course provides essential skills for entering one of blockchain's most dynamic fields.

## Learning Objectives

- **Set up** an Anchor workspace and define program state using `#[account]` with automatic serialization.
- Define instruction accounts using `#[derive(Accounts)]` and utilize Anchor's constraint system (`init`, `mut`, `close`, `has_one`).
- Develop and test Anchor instruction handlers with proper error handling and validation.
- Implement Cross-Program Invocations (CPIs) for interacting with other Solana programs, including SPL Token.
- Master various Anchor account types (`Account<'info, T>`, `Signer<'info>`, `Program<'info, T>`, `SystemAccount<'info>`).
- Design and manage application state using Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) with canonical bump patterns.
- Apply comprehensive security best practices for both PDAs and CPIs.
- Build a complete Decentralized Event Ticketing System demonstrating all learned concepts.
- Write comprehensive tests using Bankrun for 10x faster test execution.
- Optimize programs for compute units and implement upgrade mechanisms.

## Prerequisites

  - **Rust Book:** https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
- Familiarity with the Solana Command Line Interface.
