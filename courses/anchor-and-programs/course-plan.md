# Anchor and Programs: Framework Fundamentals to Production Blockchain Applications

## Overview

This comprehensive course provides a deep dive into the Anchor framework for Solana program development over 15 weeks. It guides learners from foundational concepts, such as workspace setup and state definition, to advanced techniques like Cross-Program Invocations (CPIs) and Program Derived Addresses (PDAs). The curriculum emphasizes **secure smart contract development** and how Anchor's type-safe abstractions enable building sophisticated on-chain applications. To solidify these concepts, the course culminates in building a **Multi-Signature Protocol Engine** over three weeks. This project serves as a practical application of Anchor's core features, demonstrating real-world blockchain solutions.

The primary goal is to equip developers with production-ready Anchor skills, enabling them to build, test, and deploy secure on-chain programs. The course emphasizes a project-driven, hands-on approach where learners progressively develop sophisticated blockchain applications over 15 weeks.

## Learning Objectives

- Set up an Anchor workspace and define program state using `#[account]` with automatic serialization.
- Define instruction accounts using `#[derive(Accounts)]` and utilize Anchor's constraint system (`init`, `mut`, `close`, `has_one`).
- Develop and test Anchor instruction handlers with proper error handling and validation.
- Implement Cross-Program Invocations (CPIs) for interacting with other Solana programs, including SPL Token.
- Master various Anchor account types (`Account<'info, T>`, `Signer<'info>`, `Program<'info, T>`, `SystemAccount<'info>`).
- Design and manage application state using Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) with canonical bump patterns.
- Apply comprehensive security best practices for both PDAs and CPIs.
- Build a complete Decentralized Event Ticketing System demonstrating all learned concepts.
- Write comprehensive tests using Litesvm.
- Optimize programs for compute units and implement upgrade mechanisms.

## Prerequisites

  - **Solana Docs:** https://solana.com/docs
- Comfort with Rust syntax, ownership model, and common data structures.
- Basic understanding of blockchain architecture and public key cryptography.
