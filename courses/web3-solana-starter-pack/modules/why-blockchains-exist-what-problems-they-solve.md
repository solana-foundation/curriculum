# Why Blockchains Exist (and what problems they solve)

---

## A moment you already know

Imagine you're buying tickets for a concert. You send money through a middleman, wait days, and when the tickets finally arrive… they’re fake. When you ask the bank for help, they say, “We can’t reverse it.”

Or picture sending $50 to a cousin abroad. The fees eat 20%, and the transfer takes three days.

We live in a world packed with middlemen—banks, brokers, platforms like Ticketmaster—who keep records, take cuts, and sometimes leave us hanging.

That’s why **blockchains exist**: not just as technology, but as a new agreement born from distrust.

## What’s the real problem?

1. **Trust is expensive.**  
   Every transaction comes with a cut paid to the “trusted” third party.

2. **Censorship happens.**  
   Banks freeze accounts. Platforms ban users. Rights get revoked.

3. **Transparency is rare.**  
   How much of that fee is real? The answer is usually hidden.

4. **Access is unequal.**  
   Many don’t have a bank but do have a phone. Middlemen often exclude them.

## How blockchains flip the script

- **Open ledgers** let anyone verify history.  
- **Consensus** means no single gatekeeper can rewrite the past.  
- **Smart contracts** are agreements that enforce themselves.  
- **Global-first design** means if you have internet, you can join.

And Solana? It’s blockchain with a jet engine—fast, affordable, and built for real life, not just crypto nerds.

## Quick recap

- **Blockchains exist** because higher transparency, fairness, and inclusion are urgently needed.  
- They replace middlemen with math and shared trust.  
- Solana takes those principles and makes them fast enough for everyday use.

## Explain It Yourself

Finish the sentence:

_**“Blockchains matter because they…”**_

Say it out loud, write it in your notes, or teach it to a friend. If you can explain it simply, you really understand the *why*.
