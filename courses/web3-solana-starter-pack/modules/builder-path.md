# üèÜ What‚Äôs Next: Your Builder Path

## You‚Äôve done real work

You‚Äôve moved from ‚ÄúWhat is blockchain?‚Äù to actually swapping, sending, and exploring real on-chain activity. That‚Äôs not trivia, that‚Äôs fluency. Now let‚Äôs turn that momentum into building.

## Two ways to start (pick one, or mix)

**Maker path (light code):** stitch together wallet + tokens + NFTs to make something people can use.  
**Coder path (deeper code):** write or extend on-chain programs (smart contracts) and wire up a simple front end.

## A 7-step builder loop (repeatable)

This isn‚Äôt a rigid ‚Äú7 days and you‚Äôre done‚Äù sprint. Think of it as a **loop you can repeat**: the first time you‚Äôll just get it working, the second (or third) time you‚Äôll deepen your skills.

**Step 1 ‚Äì Environment**  
Install the core tools:  

- [Install Solana CLI](https://solana.com/docs/intro/installation)  
- [Install Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation)  
- [Download Phantom Wallet](https://phantom.app/download)  
Bookmark: [Quick Start Guide](https://solana.com/docs/intro/quick-start), [Solana Cookbook](https://solana.com/developers/cookbook).  

**Step 2 ‚Äì On-chain moves**  

- [Request SOL airdrop on Devnet](https://solana.com/docs/intro/devnet)  
- [Create and send an SPL token](https://solana.com/developers/cookbook/tokens)  
- [Inspect in Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com?cluster=devnet)  

**Step 3 ‚Äì Your first contract**  

- [Anchor counter example](https://book.anchor-lang.com/chapter_3/the_counter_program.html)  
- [Deploy to devnet](https://solana.com/developers/cookbook/programs/deploy)  
- [Test with a client script](https://solana.com/developers/cookbook/clients/javascript)  

**Step 4 ‚Äì NFTs as keys**  

- [Mint an NFT on devnet (Metaplex guide)](https://developers.metaplex.com/token-metadata/minting)  
- [Gate a page with NFT ownership](https://developers.metaplex.com/guides/nft-gating)  

**Step 5 ‚Äì Front end**  

- [Use Solana Wallet Adapter](https://solana-labs.github.io/wallet-adapter/) to connect wallets  
- [Read token balances with Web3.js](https://solana.com/developers/cookbook/clients/javascript#get-token-balance)  
- Call your program from a minimal React app  

**Step 6 ‚Äì Ship a demo**  

- Push your project to [GitHub](https://github.com) with a README  
- Share it in [Solana Tech Discord](https://discord.com/invite/solana) or [Stack Exchange](https://solana.stackexchange.com)  

**Step 7 ‚Äì Reflect & iterate**  

- Write down what broke and how you fixed it  
- Plan the next loop: payments app, NFT ticketing, a game item, or a guestbook contract  

## Tools you‚Äôll lean on

- [Solana Developers Hub](https://solana.com/developers)  
- [Solana Cookbook](https://solana.com/developers/cookbook)  
- [Anchor docs](https://www.anchor-lang.com)  
- [Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io)  
- [Metaplex Dev Hub](https://developers.metaplex.com)  
- [Jupiter dev docs](https://dev.jup.ag/docs)  

## First projects to try after the loop

1. **Tip jar with receipts:** a one-click tip button that writes a note on-chain.  
2. **NFT-gated page:** only NFT holders can view.  
3. **Program + UI:** a simple Anchor ‚Äúguestbook‚Äù with wallet login.  

## Craft, safety, mindset

- Always start on **devnet**  
- Keep a small SOL buffer for fees  
- If you don‚Äôt understand a wallet prompt, don‚Äôt sign it  
- Small steps ‚Üí ship ‚Üí repeat. That‚Äôs how real builders grow.  

## Quick recap

You now have a **repeatable builder loop**: set up, transact, deploy, mint, connect, share, reflect. Each cycle builds confidence and real skill.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Explain it yourself

Finish this: **‚ÄúIn the next loop, I will build‚Ä¶‚Äù**  
If you can say it clearly, you can do it.
