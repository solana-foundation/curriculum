# 🔄 Try a Swap & Send Payment

## 💸 Why every payment feels slower than it should  

Think about the last time you tried sending money to someone abroad. Maybe it was through your bank or PayPal, the fees stacked up, and the money crawled its way over in days, not seconds.  

Now imagine the opposite: sending value anywhere in the world as easily as sending an email. That’s what happens on Solana. Swapping tokens and paying friends doesn’t just save money — it feels instant, like magic.  

## 🪙 What’s really happening?  

A **swap** is simply trading one token for another. Think of it like exchanging dollars for euros at the airport, except it happens in seconds and the booth never closes. On Solana, swaps are powered by decentralized exchanges like [Jupiter](https://jup.ag) and [Raydium](https://raydium.io).  

A **send** is moving a token or NFT to someone else’s wallet. That’s like handing cash to a friend, except it works across the world and costs less than a cent.  

And yes, you can send NFTs too. That’s like gifting a concert ticket or an in-game collectible, which then appears in your friend’s wallet under Collectibles in Phantom.  

## 🛠 Step-by-step: Try it yourself  

**Swapping tokens**  

1. Open your [Phantom wallet](https://phantom.com/download).  
2. Click the **Swap** tab.  
3. Select SOL to USDC (or any token pair).  
4. Enter the amount and confirm.  
5. Watch the swap complete in seconds for less than a cent in fees.  

**Sending tokens**  

1. In Phantom, click on the token you want to send.  
2. Select **Send** and paste your friend’s wallet address (or scan their QR code).  
3. Confirm, and the token arrives in their wallet almost instantly.  

**Sending an NFT**  

1. Go to your Collectibles tab in Phantom.  
2. Choose an NFT and hit **Send**.  
3. Paste your friend’s wallet address and confirm.  

If you don’t see anything in your Collectibles, it just means you don’t own an NFT yet, and that’s perfectly fine.  

## 🔍 Check your transaction on-chain  

After swapping or sending, Phantom gives you an explorer link. Click it, and it opens in [Solscan](https://solscan.io) or [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com). That’s your blockchain receipt: public, verifiable, and tamper-proof.  

## ⚡ The first-time magic  

The first time you see a swap complete in two seconds for less than $0.01, it feels surreal. Most people laugh because they’re so used to waiting days and paying $30 in fees elsewhere. This is the Solana difference: speed and scale that make crypto practical for everyday life.  

## 🛡 Safety tips  

- Always double-check wallet addresses before sending. A single typo means your tokens are gone forever.  
- Test with a small amount if you’re sending to someone new.  
- Use official links only: [Phantom](https://phantom.com/download), [Jupiter](https://jup.ag), [Raydium](https://raydium.io). Fake sites exist.  
- If a swap fails because of low liquidity, don’t panic. Just try again with a smaller amount or let Jupiter find another pool.  

## ✅ Quick recap  

- Swaps let you trade tokens instantly, like currency exchange without the hassle.  
- Sends let you pay anyone directly, globally, for pennies.  
- NFTs transfer just like tokens, showing up under Collectibles.  
- Explorers serve as your blockchain receipts, visible on Solscan or Explorer.  
- Solana makes all of this fast, cheap, and accessible.  

## ✍️ Explain it yourself  

Say it out loud or jot it down:  

**“A swap on Solana is different from a bank exchange because…”**  
**“Sending SOL to a friend is different from PayPal because…”**  

If you can explain it simply, you’ve mastered it.
