# 🪂 Solana Starter Pack

## Who’s This Guide For? 🤔

This is for anyone who’s curious about crypto but doesn’t know where to start.

Maybe you’ve heard words like **wallets**, **staking**, or **NFTs** thrown around and thought: *“Okay… but what does that actually mean for me?”*

You’re in the right place.

Think of this as a **friendly on-ramp to Solana**. If 10/10 is a Solana developer wizard, this guide is for anyone between **0 and 5**.

We’ll start with the basics, walk you through your first steps, and show you what’s possible on Solana.

And yes, it’s okay if you don’t understand everything at first. Nobody does. That’s the point of starting here.

You can also share this starter pack with friends who are starting their own journey: *(we will insert the link for this when it is ready)*

## How to Use This Solana Starter Pack

This pack is broken into 8 short sections. You can jump around, but most people find it easiest to go in order.

Here’s how it works:

1. **Open the toggles** → that’s where the **core ideas in plain English** live.
2. **Follow the links** → they’re not “extras.” They’re your *real teachers*.
3. **Do the recaps** → at the end of each section, test yourself by explaining what you learned in your own words. That’s how you go from *“I kinda get it”* → *“I actually understand it.”*
