# Solana Components and System Design

## Overview

This course offers a high-level exploration of Solana's architecture, its core components, and the interplay between them that enables high performance and scalability. The focus is on conceptual understanding and systems thinking, rather than low-level coding. Learners will delve into the Solana transaction lifecycle, the roles of validators and leaders, the runtime, Sealevel, Proof of History (PoH), Tower BFT, and other critical architectural elements.

The final project involves designing a scalable decentralized application (dApp) architecture on Solana. This requires students to apply their understanding of Solana's system design principles to a practical use case, justifying architectural choices and discussing trade-offs.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the core architectural components of the Solana network (Validators, Leaders, Runtime, Sealevel, PoH, Tower BFT).
- Explain the Solana transaction lifecycle and how transactions are processed.
- Analyze how Solana's design achieves high performance and scalability.
- Apply Solana's system design principles to architecting decentralized applications.
- Evaluate design trade-offs when building dApps on Solana.
- Create a detailed design document for a scalable dApp, articulating architectural choices.
- Conceptualize solutions for achieving performance and reliability in decentralized systems.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of blockchain technology (e.g., what a blockchain is, consensus mechanisms, smart contracts).
- Familiarity with fundamental concepts of distributed systems.
- Conceptual knowledge of how blockchains operate is essential.
- Prior exposure to Solana terminology is beneficial but not strictly required.
